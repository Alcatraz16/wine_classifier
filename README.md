## Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the quality of wine based on its chemical properties using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The project also includes a Streamlit UI for user-friendly interaction.

##### Models Used

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Among these models, XGBoost provided the best results after hyperparameter tuning with f-1 score of 93% .

##### Features

Interactive Streamlit UI for easy prediction

Multiple ML models for comparison

Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score displayed

##### Usage

Enter the wine characteristics in the input fields.

Click on "Predict Quality" to see the result (Good or Bad Quality).
